# CASCLIK
CasADi based closed-loop inverse kinematics.

## Introduction
This is a library for running some standard closed-loop inverse kinematics approaches such as the Set-Based task control approach [1], and reactive QP control [2].
It is a prototyping library meant for comparing overall strategies, and although capable of running quite fast, is not the best solution for real-time or finalized industrial applications.
It conceptually borrows from the eTaSL software, and we suggest that users use that for more finalized implementations.
